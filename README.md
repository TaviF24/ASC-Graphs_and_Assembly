# ASC-Graphs operations
## About
An assembly-based project with the role of introduction to a low level programming language, solving some graphs operations.

## The code
The code is made to resolve 3 tasks:
1. The resulting matrix from an adjacency list;

The input looks like this:

The output for this input is
```
  0 1 1 0
  0 0 1 1
  0 0 0 1
  0 0 0 0
```


3. The sortest path between 2 nodes;
4. The sortest path between 2 nodes using dynamic memory allocation.



## What I used
