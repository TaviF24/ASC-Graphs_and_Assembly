# ASC-Graphs operations
## About
An assembly-based project with the role of introduction to a low level programming language, solving some graphs operations.

## The code
The code is made to resolve 3 tasks:
1. The resulting matrix from an adjacency list;
   The input looks like this:

The output for this input is
```
  0 1 1 0
  0 0 1 1
  0 0 0 1
  0 0 0 0
```


2. The number of **k-length** paths between 2 nodes;
   The input looks like this:

The output for this input is
```
2
```

3. The number of **k-length** paths between 2 nodes using dynamic memory allocation.
For this task, you can use the same input as before. The output is the same.


## What I used
- Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
- Language: Assembly x86 AT&T syntax
